 		<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica" id="headtext"> The Evolution of The Kanye Rant </h1>
 		<p id="text0" style="font-size: 16px"> Grammy award winning rapper Kanye West is no stranger to pushing buttons. From the first time he came on the scene, he's never held his tongue. Many people, however, may look at his outbursts as random, rude or they just completely misunderstand his message. His rants, however, are directly parallel to the lyrics in his music. In this timeline, the top bar represents 7 of his rants and the bottom bar represents 7 of his song lyrics that coorelate to what he said. Though this is only a snapshot of West's many rants, this highlights some of the most remembered.<p>
